        <img src="img/aus.jpg" alt="great barrier reef">
        <p class="text">The Great Barrier Reef doesn't really need much of an introduction It is the single largest composition of living organisms in the world,and without a shadow of a doubt, nature's most revelled masterpiece.A vacation at the Great Barrier Reef will definitely be right up there with the best memories you'll have in the span of your life. Endless sea, a sprawling archipelago, and the unreal coral reef under the water just make for a mesmerising scene altogether. There is so much to do at the reef! You can cruise through the islands and the reef, dive underwater for an up close and personal tour of the amazing beauty of the coral, go on bushwalks on islands such as the Hayman, relax on beaches for hours on end, or even skydive over the Heart Reef, perhaps the most scenic dive spot in the world. </p>

    <li><h3>Colosseum, Rome</h3></li>
        <img class="london" src="img/rome.jpg" alt="Colosseum">  
        <p class="text">This was originally called the Flavian Amphitheatre and was mostly used as public entertainment arena. The Colosseum is one of the most famous attractions in Rome and is where most gladiatorial fights took place. Today, actors in gladiator clothes stand outside the Colosseum, where you can take pictures with them (for a price!) The Colosseum is a testament to the ingenuity of the builders, having stood the test of time. While parts have been damaged, the Colosseum still remains standing in most of its original glory today. It is advisable that you buy your tickets in advance to skip the ticketing queue, which can be quite the time saver!</p>
